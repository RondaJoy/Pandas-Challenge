    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of factors which have the potential to impact academic performance.  In this report we will evaluate each in turn to reveal strategies contributing to student success and failure.  It is my hope that this information will allow you to make data-driven decisions for the betterment of the education system and our entire community.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Factors for Consideration:\n",
    "    \n",
    "•\tConsistency across all grades (9-12)\n",
    "•\tBudgetary allocation (per student spend)\n",
    "•\tSize of School (# of students enrolled)\n",
    "•\tType of School:  Charter vs District\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmark for Comparison: \n",
    "    \n",
    "•\tStandardized testing scores for Math\n",
    "•\tStandardized testing scores for Reading\n",
    "•\tMeasure of Success:  % of students with passing scores in both subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "    *See FIGURE 1 in Images folder.\n",
    " \n",
    "    CONCLUSION:  Testing scores are relatively consistent across all grades at all schools.  Factors influencing academic success are occurring at the level of school administration rather than an inconsistency of the curriculum itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Budgetary Allocation (per student spending)\n",
    "\n",
    "    *See FIGURE 2 in Images folder.\n",
    " \n",
    "    NOTE:  There is a spending gap of [seventy-seven dollars] per student between the school that is most well-funded and least well-funded.  Furthermore, there is an average disparity of $44.07 per student between District schools and Charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *See FIGURE 3 in Images folder.\n",
    " \n",
    "    CONCLUSION:  There is a clear and consistent negative correlation between per student spending and academic success.  According to this analysis, higher funding does not appear to benefit student success. A thorough evaluation of funding allocation within each school may help to elucidate further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Size of School  \n",
    "\n",
    "    *See FIGURE 4 in Images folder.\n",
    " \n",
    "    CONCLUSION:  Small and medium-sized schools show consistent correlation with higher testing scores.  There is a substantial drop in academic success once the number of enrollees exceed 2000 students.  Subsequent analysis should be performed to assess class size (i.e. student to teacher ratio) for each of the schools included in this report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type of School:  Charter vs. District\n",
    "\n",
    "    *See FIGURE 5 in Images folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With the exception of Wilson High School, a large charter school, significantly fewer students attending large (district) schools are seeing the same degree of academic success as their counterparts who attend charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *See FIGURE 6 in Images folder.\n",
    " \n",
    "    CONCLUSION:  Students who attend a charter school are performing significantly better on standardized tests than those who attend a district school and this success is achieved at a lower per student cost to the school district.  If neither spending nor the curriculum are contributors to this success, we must conclude that school size has considerable influence over academic performance.\n",
