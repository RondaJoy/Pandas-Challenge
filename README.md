# Pandas-Challenge
Repo for Module 4 (Pandas) Homework Assignment

The purpse of the materials contained within this repository is to provide the school board with an insightful, data-driven report to be used for decision-making purposes.  This report includes an aggregate of standardized test scores, current spend, number of students enrolled and type of school (among other demographics).  

Contents include:
1 x All-inclusive Python script (with written report)
6 x .png images (please refer to images when reading data analysis report)
2 x .csv file
1 x README file

No citations this week.  I did LOTS of research and reading online but did not directly use any shared code.
